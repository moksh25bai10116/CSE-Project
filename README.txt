README.txt – Student Money Manager (Humanized Version)

Hey! So this little project is something I put together to help keep
track of my money because honestly, I kept forgetting where all my cash
was going. This script basically lets me add whatever income I get and
note down my expenses so I don’t end up broke without knowing why
(again).

What This Project Does

-   Lets you add income (like pocket money, some random friend paying
    you back, etc.)
-   Lets you add expenses (food, travel, impulse purchases… all the
    usual culprits)
-   Shows you your current balance whenever you want
-   Keeps a simple history of everything so you can scroll back and
    judge your past decisions
-   Stores everything in a JSON file so it doesn’t vanish when you close
    the program

Why I Chose This

I just needed something easy to manage my money. A full app
felt like overkill, and this was a nice small Python project that I
could actually finish without crying.

How To Use It

1.  Make sure you have Python installed. (Pretty important.)
2.  Put all the project files in one folder.
3.  Open the terminal/cmd in that folder.
4.  Run this: python student_money_manager.py
5.  Just follow the menu that pops up. It’s pretty straightforward.

Files Included

-   student_money_manager.py
    → The main program. This is where everything runs.
-   money_data.json
    → This file gets created automatically. It saves whatever you add.
    No need to touch it.
-   README.txt
    → Yep, the thing you’re reading right now.

A Few Notes

-   If the JSON file doesn’t exist, don’t worry, the program builds it
    for you.
-   I kept the code simple on purpose, so it’s easy to read and
    (hopefully) easy to modify.
-   No extra libraries needed. It’s all plain Python.
